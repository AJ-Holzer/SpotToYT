# SpotToYT

Converts all public Spotify playlists to YT-Music playlists

## Installation

1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in terminal
2. Run `playwright install` in terminal to install playwright binaries _(needed for Chromium/Firefox/WebKit)_

   Optional, but if you want to install a specific browser:

   ```bash
   playwright install chromium
   playwright install firefox
   playwright install webkit
   ```

3. Now run the `main.py` file. Done!
